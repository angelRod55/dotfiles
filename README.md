# dotfiles
This is where I keep all of the various dotfiles for different programs I use.

Feel free to copy any of the dotfiles or scripts you find here, as much of it is just copied from others' dotfiles. 
Most config files for various programs can be found in the .config directory. Shell scripts can be found in the .local/bin directory.
